#CompetitiveProgrammingProblems
There is a template for testing and running your solution.
## Step when you solve a problem
- Duplicate the folder ProbTemp
- Rename the folder to your choice
- Put your solution in main.cpp
- Put the test case in folder testcase with format test\_case\_name.inp
- Put the correct output for the corresponding test case in test\_case\_name.out
- You can have multiple test cases, just make sure the test case input and output file name match
- Then run ./run
- The script will compile and run your solution against the test case you put in the testcase folder and let you know which test case passes
